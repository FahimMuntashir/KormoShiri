# KormoShiri

Bangladeshi Problem: A common issue faced by fresh graduates in Bangladesh is the requirement for "prior experience" in entry-level jobs. However, there are few structured platforms where students can gain practical experience before graduation.
KormoShiri Innovation: KormoShiri introduces structured micro-internships with local startups, non-profits, rural MSMEs, and even local government offices. These internships are short-term (1–4 weeks) and designed to fit student schedules. After completing each internship, students receive verified digital tokens or certificates that employers can trust. This helps build an "experience portfolio" before graduation.
